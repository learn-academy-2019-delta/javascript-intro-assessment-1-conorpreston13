# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is an action that can be called by using variables. They can be called to perform that action.

  Researched answer: Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.


2. What is a method?

  Your answer: Methods are like functions, but in objects.

  Researched answer: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition


3. List 5 examples of JavaScript string methods.

  Your answer: .length, .toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), concat(), 

  Researched answer: .length, .indexOf(), search(), .leastIndexOf(), slice()


4. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: .push, .pop, .splice, .split, .join

  Researched answer: toString(), .pop, .push, .join(), shift


5. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Provide an example of each.

  Your answer: accessors do not change the original code. mutators do. Accessor: concat Mutator: push

  Researched answer: Accessor is a checker, but Mutator is a changer. 


6. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: Return will give you a response from a function, console.log will show the response in terminal.

  Researched answer: return is a keyword that terminates a function and possibly returns a value to the caller of that function. console.log will not influence the flow of your code.


7. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: variables can be used in defferent functions to return different responses. An argument for a function is the specific value that will be passed through

  Researched answer: A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters. Parameter is variable in the declaration of function. Argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to function.


8. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: it is a front end language that allows you to view and interact with any applications

  Researched answer:JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.


9. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer: In pair programmimg, you hav a 'driver' and a 'navigator'. The drive is the person who uses the keyboard and makes the input. The navigator watches and talks with the driver to find solutions and also keeps an eye out for any errors or mistakes that the driver encounters or makes.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.


10. What is one thing we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: the main thing for me would be pair-programming. I am used to working solo, so this is a very important technique for me to learn in ordedr to succeed.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
